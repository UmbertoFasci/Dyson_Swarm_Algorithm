# Dyson Swarm Algorithm
A concept experiment: an algorithm built upon the idea of The Dyson Sphere. The algorithm design is structured into three seperate regimes. The first: agents identify high value areas on spherical surface. Second: Agents coordinate movement to high value location and 'absorb' values. (This can be represented by a color change threshold on both sides, where the agent gains until threshold is met, and area source drains till threshold is met; The agent threshold should have significantly lower storage capabilities). Third: once full, agents travel to orbiting storage entity where it deposits value until the agent returns to original state. Once the source area is depleted, a new area of high value is randomly generated, and agents begin search again.

This should allow for a proper challenge to fascilitate research and stimulate growth. With the design concept complete, all that is left is to do my very best to simulate my personal concept for proper visualization.
